here to delete the tree we have two ways(steps done on traversal.cpp)
1. postorder traversal with deleting its childs(only a function needed). 
2. we can make a dstructor call in TreeNode.cpp with same code(still had to use delete root).



2. we are not creating function for deletion we are using recursion and making it very simple to delete all mememry.BY just calling only delete root in main.
1.we are making seperate function for deletion
