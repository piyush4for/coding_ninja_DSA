heap is data structure that is CBT(complete binary tree)(i.e, only last level left to right can be empty in binary tree)
priority queue can be implemeted using heap becoz it would be faster to getminmax or removeMinMax


we are storing CBT as array for Heap.If asked why used as array not pointer binary tree tell becoz there would be messy pointers and extra storage

Min-Heap = it should be CBT and root value is always shorter than child
Max-Heap = it should be CBT and root value is always larger than child

NOTE: in short heap is a data structure for finding and removing min max of numbers fastest .
